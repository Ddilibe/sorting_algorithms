# Sorting Algorithms
A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The aim of this project is to educate the student on matters concerning time and space complexity, Big-O notation and sorting algorithm.

| Files | Explanation |
-----------------------
| 0-bubble\_sort.c | Contains a function that sorts an array of intehers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm |
| 0-O | Contains the big O notation of the time complexity if the bubblesort algorithm |
| 0-selection\_sort.c | Contains a function that sorts an array of integers ina scending order using sorting algorithm |
| 0-2 | Contains the Big O notation of the time complexity if the selection sort algorithm |
